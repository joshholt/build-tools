TODO list:

- finding a way to deal with the build of canvas. node-canvas has a few dependencies
  which might need to be included as binary in order to make things install easily
  the node-canvas package doesn't include these deps, but they are required to make
  the slicing work.

- decision on how to do configuration:
  - executable/built-in (as it is now
  - external json files

- cleanup of old code
- writing tests
- writing docs
- adding generators (?)
- adding per-app automatic Sproutcore versioning (?)
- npm installer
